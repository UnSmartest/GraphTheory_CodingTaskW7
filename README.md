# Travelling Salesman Problem
### Definition
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science and mathematics.In other words, a salesman needs to visit several cities once and return home, and he wants to minimize the total travel cost or distance.
Formal Definition

Given:

A set of n vertices (cities).
A distance (or cost) matrix C[i][j] representing the distance from city i to city j.

Find:

A Hamiltonian cycle (a cycle that visits every city exactly once and returns to the start)
with minimum total cost
